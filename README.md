# 🧐 Project philosophy <a id="projectPhilosophy"></a>

We see the importance of being able to concentrate valuable information into a single area. By building a platform that allows the sharing of keystone information in upholding land fertility for future generations provided by The Institute of Education and Regenerative Communities to farmers; we can create a focal point of valuable information from our client to the farmers. 

Alternatives to our solution could be a potential option, however, creating this project with the sole intention of providing educational programs to farmers, we are able to meet every need of our client that they desire. Using an open-source project could meet some aspects that our client needs but aren’t able to fully captivate their ideas. This is where we come in and build a website to fully materialize their ideas. By working with the client directly and understanding their vision, it allows us to satisfy their goals and adjust to any requirement they may have.

# 👨‍💻 Technical Wiki <a id="wiki"></a>

Hey, glad to see you here! You must be interested in our technical stack. 

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the website uses:

- This project uses the [React](https://reactjs.org/) for constructing user interface. React is a user interface library coded with JavaScript. It is a tool to build components of the website for displaying.
- For persistent storage (database), the website uses the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) which allows for user authentication and data transaction.

For more information on the technologies that power this website, check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/lzheng0212/JD_SLS1105/wiki/Technical-Wiki) from this project.
